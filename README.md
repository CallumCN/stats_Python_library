# A Python library consolidating statistical modeling libraries

This repository contains code that I have been employed to write for an open source project to create a new Python library for statistical analysis. The library will consolidate APIs for various data sources and provide standard features for data transformation and modeling.

The repository currently contains python_stats_library_project.ipynb, in which I am creating classes and functions for the library. The file currently contains two classes. The first takes data and variables of interest and provides access to models in other libraries, with statsmodels' OLS model as a test case. The second class inherits from the basic modeling classes of statsmodels and nixtla.
